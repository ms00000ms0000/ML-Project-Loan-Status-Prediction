# 🏦 ML Project - Loan Status Prediction  

## 🚀 Overview  
This **Machine Learning project** is a **Loan Status Prediction System** that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant details such as **Gender, Marital Status, Dependents, Education, Employment Type, Applicant Income, Coapplicant Income, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Credit History, and Property Area**.  

The dataset was analyzed through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and correlations.  

The model was developed using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Linear kernel** and achieved an **accuracy of 79%**.  

This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning** can enhance **loan approval processes** through **data-driven decision-making**.
